## Frame Skipping: Boosting Tracker

Colab for frame skipping in the setting of combining boosting tracker and YOLO MobileNet (optional as we later convert the jupternotebook into local python file to run all experiments)

### How to run
1. download all the files in this [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mR1U6gVOxfXT8w__yRZB-nsBTibKDh8G?usp=sharing) to your google drive.

2. run demo_v1_1.ipynb. First, mount your system to your drive. Second, pip install the packages in the code segment. Third, restart Runtime.

3. Run the left code blocks sequentially until second last block. Go to output directory and create a directory yolov3mobile${fps}  (e.g. yolov3mobile10)

4. In the last block, set the fps you want and then run it.

5. The results will be in output/yolov3mobile{fps} directory in your google drive.
